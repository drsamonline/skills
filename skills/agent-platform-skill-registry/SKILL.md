# Skill Registry

This skill provides instructions for interacting with the **Skill Registry** on
the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform.

## Attribution

**MUST READ**: Before executing any `gcloud`, REST API, or MCP command, you
MUST read [Usage Attribution](references/attribution.md). For commands executed
directly in the terminal (never in generated scripts, Terraform, or user code),
prefix `gcloud` with
`CLOUDSDK_METRICS_REQUEST_ATTRIBUTION="agent-skills/1.0 (skill:agent-platform-skill-registry)"`
and append
`agent-skills/1.0 (skill:agent-platform-skill-registry)`
to `User-Agent` headers.

## Core Capabilities

-   **Skill Discovery** - Query the registry to easily search, list, get
    specific skills, and inspect revision histories.
-   **Skill Lifecycle Management** - Upload, update, or permanently delete
    skills.
-   **Operation Monitoring** - Utility to check the completion status of
    long-running state changes (LROs).
-   **Generate Skill** - Automate the initial scaffolding of new agent skills
    locally.

## Core Directives

-   **Mandatory Validation**: ALWAYS execute the environment validation check
    before performing any operations.

    Before any operation, you **must** validate the core environment.

    ```bash
    # Execute the validation script
    python3 scripts/validate_env.py
    ```

## Prerequisites & Authentication

### Library & Authentication

Ensure you have the latest Google Cloud credentials and libraries installed.

```bash
# Install required libraries
pip install google-auth requests

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Environment Variables

The following variables are required for operations:

-   `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud Project ID.
-   `GCP_LOCATION`: The region (e.g., `us-central1`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quickstart

Quickly search for available skills in the registry:

```bash
python3 scripts/skill_registry_ops.py search \
  --query "test skill" \
  --top-k 5
```
